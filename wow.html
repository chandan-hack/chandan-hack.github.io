	<center><h1> Database Management System </h1></center>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to create, define, manipulate and manage databases. It provides a way for organizations to store, organize and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently in an organized manner. A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that handles the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It acts as an interface between users and databases, allowing for efficient data operations.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Data definition:</b> Creating and modifying database structures </li>
		<li><b>Data manipulation:</b> Inserting, updating, and deleting data </li>
		<li><b>Data querying:</b> Retrieving specific information </li>
		<li><b>Access control:</b> Managing user permissions and security</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>What is data in DBMS? </h2>
	<p>In a Database Management System (DBMS), data refers to the actual information stored within the database, which can be organized into various formats like text, numbers, and dates. It's the core component that the DBMS manages and provides access to. Essentially, data is the collection of facts, figures, or details that the database is designed to hold and manage. </p>
	<h2> Database</h2>
	<p>Databases are essential for storing and managing data in todayâ€™s digital world. They serve as the backbone of various applications, from simple personal projects to complex enterprise systems. Understanding the different types of databases is crucial for choosing the right one based on specific requirements. This article explores all major types of databases, their characteristics, advantages, and applications.</p>
	<p>A database is an organized collection of data that is electronically stored and accessed. Databases can store structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data, such as text, images, videos, and files, making them indispensable for modern applications. They are managed using Database Management Systems (DBMS), which are software tools that enable users to create, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently.</p>
	<h2>Types of Database</h2>
	<p>Databases can be classified based on their structure, usage, storage methods, and intended application. Understanding these types will help us choose the best database for our needs.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Hierarchical databases			</li>
	<li>Network databases				</li>
	<li>Object-oriented databases		</li>
	<li>Relational databases			</li>
	<li>Cloud Database						</li>	
	<li>Centralized Database</li>
	<li>Operational Database</li>
	<li>NoSQL databases</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Software/System</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Domain-Specific Software: Accounting System</p></b></li>
		<p>	An Accounting System is a type of domain-specific software designed to handle all financial operations of an organization. It tracks and manages financial transactions, generates financial reports, and ensures compliance with accounting standards. These systems are typically designed to integrate seamlessly with other business operations like inventory management, payroll, and invoicing</li>
	</P>
		<li><p><b>Domain-Specific Software: Attendance System</p></b></li>
		<p>An Attendance System is a software application designed to manage employee attendance, track working hours, and generate reports for payroll and performance analysis. These systems can be standalone or integrated with other HR management software, providing real-time attendance tracking and automation.</p>
	</ul>
	<h2>Software Development </h2>
		<b>i) Database Design </b>
		<p>Database design is the foundational process of structuring an organization's data to support its information needs effectively and efficiently. It's an iterative process that begins long before a single line of code is written and directly impacts the performance, scalability, and maintainability of any software system.</p>
		<b>ii) Database Administration </b>
		<p>Database Administration encompasses the comprehensive management, maintenance, and operational support of database systems throughout their lifecycle. While database design focuses on the initial structure, DBA is about keeping the database healthy, secure, and performing optimally in a production environment.</p>
	<h2>Tools</h2>
	<b>i) Server </b>
	<p>In the context of databases, "server" primarily refers to the Database Server, which is the software system that manages the database and provides an interface for clients to 	access and manipulate data. It's the central component that processes queries, manages data storage, ensures data integrity, and handles security. Examples of popular database 	servers include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) </li>
		<li> NoSQL Databases </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>ii)DDL (Data Definition Language) </b>: DDL commands are used to define, modify, or delete the structure of database objects.</p>
	<p><b>iii)DML (Data Manipulation Language)</b>: DML commands are used to manipulate data within the database tables.</p>
	<p><b>iv)DCL (Data Control Language)</b>: DCL commands are used to control access permissions and manage transactional changes in the database. </p>
	<p><b>CRUD Operations</b>CRUD is an acronym that stands for the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a persistent storage:

		C - Create: Corresponds to the INSERT DML command. Adding new records to the database.

		R - Read: Corresponds to the SELECT DQL command. Retrieving data from the database.

		U - Update: Corresponds to the UPDATE DML command. Modifying existing records.

		D - Delete: Corresponds to the DELETE DML command. Removing records from the database.</p>
	<p><b>Keys in Database</b>: Keys are crucial for establishing relationships between tables and ensuring data integrity and uniqueness within a relational database.
	<ul>
		<li> Primary Key
			<ul><li>Uniquely identifies each record in a table.</li>

			<li>Must contain unique values for each row.</li>

			<li>Cannot contain NULL values (NOT NULL constraint).</li>

			<li>A table can have only one primary key.</li>

			<li>Often implemented with an auto-incrementing integer or a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).</li></ul>
		</li>
		
	</ul>
	</p>



<h2> Anomalies in Database </h2>
<p>Database anomalies are flaws in the design of a relational database that can lead to data redundancy and inconsistencies. They typically arise in poorly normalized databases.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Insertion Anomaly: Occurs when you cannot insert a new record into a table without adding information about another unrelated entity. </li>
	<li>Deletion Anomaly: Occurs when deleting a record results in the loss of other, unrelated, important information.</li>
	<li>Update Anomaly: Occurs when modifying an attribute value requires updating multiple rows, leading to potential inconsistencies if all copies are not updated.</li>
</ul>
